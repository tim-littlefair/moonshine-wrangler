### Project-specific items begin here

# This project expects to use a virtual environment in the following directory
.venv3

# The _work directory will contain artifacts we do not want in version control
_work

# We don't want to allow anything to be added to version control which was derived from 
# + _work/reference_files/factory-presets.zip or 
# + _work/reference_files/entire-archive.zip
# as FMIC might regard some or all data in the first of those files and some
# data in the second as copyright material.
# Data derived from files in _work/reference_files/intheblues.zip can be added 
# as these are the work of Shane@intheblues and he has explicitly put these in 
# the public domain.
